# Hackerrank_Game_of_Piles
Game of Piles is a two-player game where the players take turns removing stones from a pile. The number removed has to be either an integer multiple of a given number, k, where k > 0. The last player to remove a stone wins. 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.5 or higher

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Shoh96/Hackerrank_Game_of_Piles.git
   ```
   
2. Install the required packages:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
## Usage

The game can be played by running the `game_of_piles.py` file in the terminal:

```bash
python game_of_piles.py
```

The game will ask for the number of piles, the number of stones in each pile, and the value of k.

The output will be either "Sam wins the game of n pile(s)." or "Alex wins the game of n pile(s).", where n is the number of piles in the input.

## Testing

To run the test cases, install `pytest`:

```bash
pip install pytest
```

Then, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
pytest test_game_of_piles.py
```
